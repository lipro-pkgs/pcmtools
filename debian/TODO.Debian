To Do
=====

* Add support for `functional testing of Debian packages`_ with `autopkgtest`.

* Support hardening options for Position Independent Executable (PIE) and
  prevents GOT overwrite attacks (BINDNOW).
  Details see: `Debian Hardening Options`_

* Remove lintian overrides in `debian/pcmtools.lintian-overrides`. It was
  introduced to avoid the lintian warnings as an result of the missing
  hardening options in upstream source code.
