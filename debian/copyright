Upstream-Name: pcmtools - PC/M tool chain
Upstream-contact: Stephan Linz <linz@li-pro.net>
Source: https://github.com/lipro-cpm4l/pcmtools
    The pristine upstream source may contains obfuscated files, that are
    thereby not appropriate for use as source files. This violates DFSG §2.
    .
    The 'debian/repack' program will removes those files to create the Debian
    upstream source tarball.
    .
    The orig.tar.xz is just repacked Debian upstream source tarball
    (currently without changes). See section get-orig-source in 'debian/rules'
    file and array nonfree_fileglobs in 'debian/repack' file for details.
